<h1 align="center">True Windows 11 Dark!</h1>

**TrueWin11Dark** is a theme for FLow Launcher that tries to imitate the look of Window 11 dark theme. This is a modification of [CircleDarkBlur](https://github.com/z1nc0r3/CircleDarkBlur.Flow-Launcher), so all props to [z1nc0r3](https://github.com/z1nc0r3) for creating it!
